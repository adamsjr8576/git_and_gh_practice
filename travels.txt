Two summer ago my wife and I traveled around the world. We started the trip off
with two and a half weeks road tripping around the UK. WE then flew to Shanghai
we were explored the city and visited a friend that lives there. We then flew to
Cambodia and spent about 5 days exploring the Angkor temples. We then flew to Vietnam
and spent about two weeks traveling throughout the country.
